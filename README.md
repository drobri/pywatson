Python client to AT&amp;T Watson service

This program will allow user to record a short audio clip and then will send the audio (audio/wav) to AT&T Watson service using HTTPS POST with OAuth 2.0 credentials.  AT&T Watson service will then do voice recognition to text translation and send back the text to the client.

AT&T Speech API can be found at: http://developer.att.com
